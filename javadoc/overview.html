<p>Welcome to the Javadocs API for the AnimatedArchitecture project.</p>
<p>The AnimatedArchitecture API provides a way of hooking into the AnimatedArchitecture plugin. This allows you to
    control
    many aspects of the plugin, such as: Interacting with structures, react to events, initiate animations, extend the
    animated blocks, etc.</p>
<p>In this overview, we will introduce some of the key concepts you will encounter when using the Animated Architecture
    API. The documentation here is not meant to be a complete reference, but rather a quick introduction. It is
    recommended
    to read the documentation of the classes and packages you are interested in to get a better understanding of the
    API.</p>
<h2>Animated Architecture Platform</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most important class to know about when getting started with the API is
    the <a href="nl/pim16aap2/animatedarchitecture/core/api/IAnimatedArchitecturePlatform.html">IAnimatedArchitecturePlatform</a>.
    It provides access to many of the core features of the plugin.</p>
<p>The way to obtain an instance of the platform depends on the platform you are using. For Spigot, you can find an
    example
    in the <a href="nl/pim16aap2/animatedarchitecture/spigot/core/package-summary.html">Spigot core package</a>.</p>
<h2>Structures</h2>
<p>The most important concept in the AnimatedArchitecture API is the structure. A structure is an abstract
    representation
    of a collection of blocks that can be animated. The most common representation of a structure is
    the <a href="nl/pim16aap2/animatedarchitecture/core/structures/AbstractStructure.html">AbstractStructure</a> class,
    but there are
    representations, such a snapshots, immutable structures, etc.</p>
<p>It is recommended to read the documentation of
    the <a href="nl/pim16aap2/animatedarchitecture/core/structures/package-summary.html">Structure package</a> to get a
    better
    understanding of the structure concept.</p>
<p>Instead, you should use
    the
    <a href="nl/pim16aap2/animatedarchitecture/core/structures/retriever/StructureRetriever.html">StructureRetriever</a>
    class
    to obtain instances of structures. The StructureRetriever class provides a number of methods to retrieve structures
    from
    the database.</p>
<p>When you want to make changes to a structure, you should use commands when making the changes on behalf of a player.
    If
    not, you should remember to synchronize the changes with the database. More information about this can be found in
    the
    <a href="nl/pim16aap2/animatedarchitecture/core/structures/package-summary.html">Structure package</a>.</p>
<h2>Structure Retrievers</h2>
<p>Structure retrievers are used to retrieve structures from the database. They are the recommended way of obtaining an
    instance of a structure. The retrievers are created using the factory class.</p>
<p>The factory allow you to create retrievers in a number of ways. For example, you can create a structure retriever
    from a
    structure's name, by its ID, or by its pre-existing instance.</p>
<p>The structure retrievers contain several methods to obtain the instance or instances of the structure(s) they refer
    to.
    For example, you can get a list of all structures they refer to, or only those owned by a specific player, or only
    get a
    single structure in case the retriever refers to exactly structure.</p>
<p>More information about the structure retrievers can be found in
    the <a href="nl/pim16aap2/animatedarchitecture/core/structures/retriever/package-summary.html">retriever package</a>.
</p>
<h2>Commands</h2>
<p>Commands are the preferred way of making changes to structures. They allow you to make changes on behalf of a
    player.</p>
<p>More information and examples about commands can be found in
    the <a href="nl/pim16aap2/animatedarchitecture/core/commands/package-summary.html">commands package</a>.</p>
<h2>Animation Hooks</h2>
<p>The API includes two types of animation hooks that allow you to add custom behaviour either to the animations
    themselves
    or to the animated blocks that together make up an animation. More information about the animation hooks can be
    found in
    the <a href="nl/pim16aap2/animatedarchitecture/core/api/animatedblock/package-summary.html">animatedblock</a>
    package.</p>
<h2>Events</h2>
<p>The API includes a number of events that allow you to react to certain events. For example, you can react to the
    creation of a structure, to the start of an animation, or to the deletion of a structure.</p>
<p>The way to use the events depends on the platform you are using. For Spigot, you can find an example in the
    <a href="nl/pim16aap2/animatedarchitecture/spigot/core/events/package-summary.html">event package</a> for Spigot.
</p>
<p>A full list of events can be found in
    the <a href="nl/pim16aap2/animatedarchitecture/core/events/package-summary.html">event package</a>.</p>
