name: Setup steps for GitHub Copilot

# This workflow defines the setup steps required for GitHub Copilot to properly
# build and work with this project. It ensures all dependencies are downloaded
# and the project can be compiled successfully.
#
# The workflow addresses dependency resolution issues by:
# - Setting up the correct Java version (21+) required by the project
# - Caching Maven dependencies to speed up subsequent builds
# - Resolving dependencies from the configured repositories (Maven Central,
#   JitPack, GitLab Maven registry, and Sonatype)
# - Compiling the project to verify all dependencies are accessible
#
# This ensures that GitHub Copilot can successfully download and use all
# required dependencies when working with the codebase.
